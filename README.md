<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Rubén Ballester</h1>
<h3 align="center">An AI researcher specialized in graph and high-order learning from Spain 🇪🇸</h3>

- 🧑‍🦱 I'm 27 years old and based in Barcelona.
- 🧑🏽‍💻 I'm currently a PhD candidate specializing in high-order learning, topological deep learning, and graph learning at the [HuPBA lab](https://hupba.com) and the [AIDOS lab](https://aidos.group).
- 💻 I consider myself a computer scientist and applied mathematician. I work on solving computational problems—mostly in AI—using solutions grounded in mathematics. I also enjoy exploring abstract areas such as category theory, algebraic topology, and differential geometry, although I tend to be more enthusiastic about tackling challenging problems from various scientific fields, including (but not limited to) deep learning.
- ❤️ My current main interests are foundation models, program synthesis, type theory, structured (graph) learning, and AI4Maths.
- ✍️ Aside from research, I love software engineering. I enjoy exploring new design patterns and improving the efficiency of my programs, even though I don't engage in large-scale research.
- ☕ Like everyone, I love coffee.
